### Note 2 — Early Life & Formative Years

- **1992–2003:** Raised near Lake Superior in Duluth, MN. Long winters and isolation fostered introspection and an early habit of noticing patterns in nature and machines.  
- **2001:** First exposure to computers through an older sibling’s discarded desktop; learned by breaking and reassembling hardware.  
- **2004:** Became interested in diagrams, maps, and schematics—often recreating systems seen in textbooks or manuals.  
- **2007:** Began experimenting with scripting and automation to replicate repetitive tasks rather than perform them manually.
